# 002 RESTify Auth Template

This directory contains a basic template based on the popular [RESTIfy for NodeJS](http://www.restify.com).  The template is used in conjunction with the tutorials posted at [YourAPIExpert.com](http://www.yourapiexpert.com) and should be considered suitable for learning and not production use.

## Included In This Template

This template builds on the previous '001 Basic' by introducing authentication middleware in two stages:

* Local username and password authentication
* Token based authentication

This module will also introduce students to PassportJS middleware.

## How To Use This Template

Check out the repository and run 'npm install'.  Afterwards the server can be started with 'node server.js' and monitored from the console.

## How To Report Bugs

Pull requests to add new features or fix bugs are very much welcome.  Otherwise use the forums and we will see what can be done.
